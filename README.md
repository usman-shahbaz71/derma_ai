DermAI is an innovative platform that transforms dermatology through the power of artificial intelligence and digital health solutions. By harnessing advanced image recognition algorithms, DermAI offers accurate skin disease diagnosis, enabling timely interventions and personalized treatment plans. Patients can schedule appointments with dermatologists, access educational resources, and engage in remote consultations for convenient and efficient care. DermAI integrates with electronic health records, facilitating secure data management and analytics to drive clinical insights and research advancements. With a focus on patient empowerment and continuous innovation, DermAI redefines dermatological practice, improving access to care and enhancing patient outcomes for optimal skin health and well-being.

Here's a complete overview of how the DermAI app works:

Streamlit Interface:
The app is built using Streamlit, a Python framework for building web applications.
Users interact with the app through a web browser interface.

Dermatology Assistant:
The app serves as a dermatology assistant, providing users with features for image analysis, appointment scheduling, and dermatologist selection.

Image Analysis:
Users can upload images of skin conditions or provide image URLs for analysis.
The app utilizes the OpenAI API for image analysis, leveraging machine learning models to interpret skin images and provide detailed diagnosis reports.

Appointment Scheduling:
Users can book appointments with dermatologists through the app.
A MongoDB database stores appointment details, including user information, selected dermatologist, and appointment time.

User Interface:
The app's interface is designed for ease of use and accessibility.
